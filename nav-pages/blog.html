                <p>
                    On 27-28 June 2018, four members of our team attended the Blockchain Expo event in Amsterdam -

                        <a href="https://blockchain-expo.com/europe/">  Amsterdam Expo</a>
                    </div>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Our mighty Lord Architect (Mike Richardson), joined by Lady Funding (Geomina Turlea), Baron Automation (Simon Brooke) and the Duchess of Networking (Carmen Bahrim), set on a quest to grasp the industry trends and forge collaborations.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We spent most of our time roaming through the stands rather than attending presentations: might be because we found the presentations rather high-level, skimming over details and challenges, while we were keen to understand what is the potential and limits of the technology?
                        <p> Or was it that the open setting made it rather difficult to focus on the presentations in the middle of the hustle and bustle that surrounded the stands? A bit of both, perhaps. It must be said though, that we went there on a free registration tickets, so the above perception can not apply to the strands of presentations that were payable.
                        </p>
                        <p> The organisation of the event had only few small hiccups: there were unexpected changes in the scheduling of the presentations and the catering was rather poor, especially given that the RAI, the expo venue in Amsterdam, is not in an area abundant in restaurants.
                        </p>
                        <p>Otherwise, all went smooth and easy. We particularly found interesting that the expo shared the venue with two other Expos, IoT and AI, tech innovation areas of which intersect with blockchain to generate a whole new world of applications and niches.
                        </p>
                        <p> And, indeed, they do, for example in supply chain management and the automotive industry; see:
                        </p>
                        <div class="link"><a href="https://herc.one">  Hercules</a>
                            <a href="https://blockchain-expo.com/europe/partners/gluon">  Gluon</a>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Overall, congratulations to the organisers and sponsors for a very good and very successful event. According to the Expo website, 135 company registered for the event. Broadly, their area of expertise would follow into one of the following categories: cryptocurrencies and crypto-financial markets, entertainment industries (including sports and social platforms), gaming, health and other social issues, supply chain, and technology and tools. Legal and technical consultancies were also present.
                        </p>
                        <p>Pushing the teaching and research in blockchain is:

                        <p>
                            They won the award for the Biggest Contributor to the Rise of Blockchain in 2018. Most of the teams were small – up to 25 developers, but many teams had no more than 10 members. To the best of our knowledge, IBM was the only IT giant present, although both Ethereum (through Ethereum Business Alliance) and Hyperledger had stands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We were been particularly impressed by Gospel Technology:

                        </p>
                        <div class="link"> <a href="https://blockchain-expo.com/europe/partners/gospel-technology/"> Gospel</a></div>

                        <p>
                            Their project to provide the world’s first enterprise blockchain data platform. It did not come as a surprise Gospel Technology won the Best Blockchain Technology developer 2018, but we fear that their market penetration might be deterred by their very high price for use. Most companies would adopt as business model a combination of free software and ICO sales to finance the development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Few are financed by business angels, backed by big companies/EU or self-financed. Clearly, blockchain is not mainstream and many of the applications, although with very ambitious visions, only add a layer of enhanced security/transparency to an existing business solution or a platform. Some though, take such exercises to their true potential;
                        </p>
                        <div class="link"><a href="https://blockchain-expo.com/europe/partners/lendledger/"> Lend Ledger</a></div>

                        <p>
                            One example is Lend Ledger, one of the Track Sponsors, which has placed a blockchain application on top of a previously existing business model that puts together informal borrowers and lenders. A clever, generous idea that provides a lifeline to struggling small companies in developing countries and puts borrowers’ money to work. Not to forget, a model backed by international donors such as World Bank and IFC. Useful in countries like Romania. Yet, it raises questions about how it could fit with EU regulation and GDPR.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given the [financial] expertise of three members of our delegation, we were drawn to exchange platforms. We stopped at Deribit (https://blockchain-expo.com/europe/partners/deribit/), a bitcoin-only derivatives exchange:
                        </p>
                        <div class="link"> <a href="https://blockchain-expo.com/europe/partners/vega/"> Vega</a></div>

                        <p>
                            This is a platform for trading and settling smart financial products, including derivatives. There may be an issue with regulations for these DApps. Finally, we looked into the issue of data storage and analytics. Most [Ethereum] DApps use IPFS, Storj and Swarm. A few exhibitors propose a fusion between Big Data and blockchain technology, very much in line with our own thinking, Bottos being one of them:
                        </p>
                        <div class="link"> <a href="https://blockchain-expo.com/europe/partners/bottos/"> Bottos</a></div>

                        <p>
                            In this instance, however, it seems that serious data analytics on the blockchain is still not there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In short, Blockchain Expo was more about showcasing DApps than discussing tools and technologies. The cases presented are making the transition towards a new Internet architecture, considering the immaturity of some technologies (storage, analytics, messaging, scalability and latency) and the fast advancement in others (encryption especially, but also identity management). They typically were in the stage where the business case was not complete and the issues related with market adoption were not entirely thought through. Although the financial applications, partially following the fast spreading of the cryptocurrencies, are the most obvious candidates for DAPPs, the lack of regulations is stopping that development. Lack of regulation and standardization prevents mass scale adoption of the technology in the public sector as well as in financial services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Expo didn’t disappoint. With 8000+ dedicated blockchain industry attendees (according to the event page) the expo provided a feast for our thoughts; we returned wiser and on a clear path for the future. The main audience included CEO’s/CIO’s/CTO’s, Marketing Managers, ICOs and Developers. In terms of seniority: 44% Managers, 25% Directors and VP’s, 12% C-Level, 8% Press and Media, 6% Exec’s and 4% Analysts, as per the event page. Our small group covered almost all the spectrum and we left the Expo with a target in mind: next year we hope to have a stand of our own. Wish us good luck! We leave our readers by sharing our personal preferences from the stands we visited:
